## Hi there 👋

My name is Muhammad Salman, and I'm someone who does both passion projects and Open Source contributions depending on how much free time is available.

### My Projects
Here are some projects of mine that may interest you:
- **The Mini Website**: This is a website that I created for Mini, which is a constructed language of about a 1000 words. It is completely static, meaning it works lightning-fast on any computer. The website is live [here](https://muhdsalm.github.io).
- **The Lyrics Prompter**: I made this website for a sing-along I wanted to have with my friends. While I unfortunately never got to do it, the website is available on the internet for anyone to use. Like before, the website is compeletely static, meaning it uses very little system resources. You can access it [here](https://lyrics-prompter.netlify.app/).
- **The Mental Math Game**: This is an online game I have created for people to practice mental math. It is developed using the Godot game engine, and is a little heavier than the other projects. You cah play it [here](https://muhdsalm.github.io/mental-math-website/).
- **Asteriod Wars**: This was a game I created very early on in my life in collaboration with a friend. This game is a spin on the very common Asteroid Shooter game, adding things like progression, unlockable power-ups, boss battles, an in-game shop for cosmetics, etc. The game is available for download [here](https://github.com/muhdsalm/AsteroidWars2.0/releases/latest).
- **Raging Hell**: This was a game I created very recently for the DayDream Hackathon. The entirety of the game logic was created in around 12 non-consecutive hours. You can try it out [here](https://muhdsalm.itch.io/raging-hell).
- **The Fanatical Fics Database**: This is a website I made for keeping track of all the episodes in the Harry Potter podcast _Fanatical Fics and Where to Find Them_. The website features both a frontend and a backend communicating with each other. While a live version of the website is sadly unavailable, you can check out the source code of this website [here](https://github.com/muhdsalm/fanatical-fics-database).
